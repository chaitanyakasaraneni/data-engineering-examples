# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous examples before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure your list is useful before submitting. That implies it having enough content and every item a good succinct description.
- A link back to this list from yours, so users can discover more lists, would be appreciated.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Run the command `make new-example` which sets up an individual folder with a README.md file for the example you want to contribute.

- If you would already have an example as a repo and would like to add it here, just add it in the `README.md` under your example folder
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
